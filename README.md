# js-assessment solutions

This repo contains my solutions to the test-based javascript assessments found [here](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment). Working through these tests was a wonderful learning experience I highly reccommend it! 

To see that I did, in fact, pass the tests you can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm start

You can then view the tests in your browser at
